### About me

*Learner, developer, sometimes musician.*

Hi there! Iâ€™m Thomas, a software and web developer with a passion for music and sound experimentation. I start to learn programming in 2007, and I never stopped since then, either learning or programming.

I spent most of my career building software for the health sector in France, and I loved it. Now Iâ€™m just working my path into the canadian job market, go way out of my comfort zone and try to pursue my career here in Canada.

Iâ€™m proficient in PHP frameworks like Symfony and Laravel. Iâ€™m also diving into the world of Javascript, particularly ReactJS, while continuously improving my skills. Additionally, I worked with Java and Python, with the latter mainly used for scripting purposes.

Currently, Iâ€™m engaged in two exciting side projects. One is PlaylistShare, a music tracking application I use daily, built using PHP Laravel and ReactJS. The other is an experimental music album generator for HNW (Harsh Noise Wall) artists written in Rust.

I thrive on learning new things daily, solving problems, and just improving myself overall.

Beyond the tech world, Iâ€™m an avid music and video game enthusiast, an average electric guitar player, and I also enjoy spending time hiking and walking. And coffee. Is it really worth living without coffee?

### Projects

My main projects are not hosted on GitHub, but on [Framagit](https://framagit.org/blchrd) - an instance of GitLab - this account is mainly for collaborating with other people, for small project and experimentation.
