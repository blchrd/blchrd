### About me

*Learner, developer, sometimes musician.*

Hi there! Iâ€™m Thomas, a software and web developer with a passion for music and sound experimentation. Iâ€™ve been in this field since 2009, and I love delving into new projects.

In addition to my tech background, I spent 13 fulfilling years working in the health sector in France, creating software for retirement homes. However, I recently relocated to Canada in May 2023.

My main techstack is PHP / Laravel and Javascript / ReactJS, with relational database as SQLite or MySQL.

I also work with Java and Python, and currently learning Go and Rust.

Besides all of that, I always try to improve myself in many areas, I'm eager to learn almost anything in any field, all the days.

### Projects

My public repositories are not hosted on GitHub, but on [Framagit](https://framagit.org/blchrd) - an instance of GitLab - this account is mainly for collaborating with other people.

If you want to check my public works, [please check this link out](https://framagit.org/blchrd).

I have two main projects right now:

* ðŸŽ§ [PlaylistShare](https://framagit.org/playlistshare/): A web application for sharing, rating, and commenting on the albums you listen to. Currently working on multi-user features and rewriting the backend in Go for learning purposes.
* ðŸŽµ [HNW Generator](https://framagit.org/blchrd/hnwgen): An experimental music generator designed for Harsh Noise Wall artists. All the features included is enough to use it as is, right now I try to extend the applied effect. I also start a long journey to rewrite this project in Rust ([here's the Rust source](https://framagit.org/blchrd/rust-hnwgen)), I always want to learn Rust.
