### About me

*Learner, developer, sometimes musician.*

Hi there! Iâ€™m Thomas, a software developer with a passion for music and sound experimentation.

Iâ€™m an avid music and video game enthusiast, an average electric guitar player, and I also enjoy spending time hiking and walking. And coffee. Is it really worth living without coffee?

### Projects

My main projects are not hosted on GitHub, but on [Framagit](https://framagit.org/blchrd) - an instance of GitLab - this account is mainly for collaborating with other people, for small project and experimentation, mainly on procedural generation.

If you want to check my other works, [please check this link out](https://framagit.org/blchrd).

I have three main personal side projects right now:

* ðŸŽ§ [PlaylistShare](https://framagit.org/playlistshare/): A web application for sharing, rating, and commenting on the albums you listen to.
* ðŸŽµ [Procedural music generation](https://github.com/blchrd/procedural-music-generation): A small project to learn about music theory and try to generate some cool melodies.
* ðŸŽµ [HNW Generator](https://framagit.org/blchrd/rust-hnwgen/): An experimental music generator designed for Harsh Noise Wall artists written in Rust.
