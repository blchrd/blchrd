### About me

*Learner, developer, sometimes musician.*

Hi there! I’m Thomas, a software and web developer with a passion for music and sound experimentation. I’ve been in this field since 2009, and I love delving into new projects.

In addition to my tech background, I spent 13 fulfilling years working in the health sector in France, creating software for retirement homes. However, I recently relocated to Canada in May 2023.

My main techstack is PHP / Laravel and Javascript / ReactJS, with relational database as SQLite or MySQL.

I also work with Java and Python, and currently learning Go and Rust.

### Projects

My public repositories are not hosted on GitHub, this account is mainly for collaborating with other people. If you want to check my public works, [please check this link out](https://framagit.org/blchrd).

I have two main projects right now:

* 🎧 [PlaylistShare](https://framagit.org/playlistshare/): A web application for sharing, rating, and commenting on the albums you listen to. Currently finishing the search feature and rewriting the backend in Go for learning purposes.
* 🎵 [HNW Generator](https://framagit.org/blchrd/hnwgen): An experimental music generator designed for Harsh Noise Wall artists. All the features included is enough to use it as is, right now I try to extend the applied effect. I also start a long journey to rewrite this project in Rust, I always want to learn Rust.
